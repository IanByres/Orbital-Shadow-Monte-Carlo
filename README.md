# Orbital-Shadow-Monte-Carlo
MATLAB script that takes mean and 3sigma standard deviation values for classical orbital elements (COEs). Then uses Monte Carlo Method to disperse orbital elements, numerically simulates each trajectory, and computes the time spent in sun versus shadow to create a statistical distribution of sunlit time based on possible variation in COEs.
